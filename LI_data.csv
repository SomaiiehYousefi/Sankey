I have dedicated myself to learning skills that enable me to build programs, models, and platforms that would make my contribution to the community significant.  I have two post-grad diploma, in Data architecture and Business Analytics. During my study I learnt about industrial use of data to gain leverage and make business decisions that help in maximizing profit and delivering best possible product/service. Additionally, I obtained and applied skills required to acquire, manipulate, process, and visualize data in various domains using Python, Tableau, SAS and various analytical tools.  During my engineering, I explored IT and computer science as much as I could. I learned about computer networks, Data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, DBMS, and Web technologies. I built projects in Java, Python, PHP, etc and gained practical knowledge about the inner workings of databases, websites, and Android apps. Further, I also did an internship in Digital Media Marketing that helped me understand how the information flows on the internet and the marketing side of the apps that we IT guys build.  I can confidently say that now with my skill set I can work on complicated problems in the Big Data domain to provide potential solution to business problems. Thanks!

Large Global Enterprises | Software & Technology Solutions | Team Training | Sales Enablement";"Calgary, Alberta, Canada";;"I’ve built a career steeped in sales and consultative selling, but what makes me unique as an executive sales leader is my ability to enable innovation through analytics. I pounce on opportunities to leverage technology, data analytics, and AI to empower sales decisions, optimize sales performance, and propel growth and profitability.    My results?  ✔ Millions of dollars in new revenue – as much as $4M+ in 1 year ✔ New market expansion – $15M+ in identified pipeline opportunities ✔ Increased profitability – 30% gross profit margin on services ✔ Doubling of company valuation – 600% increase in service revenues   Over the years, working with a range of mid-cap to large global enterprise clients, and in both startup and established companies, I harnessed data and transformed it into insights to fuel progressive results.  Data validates decisions, improves business decisions, creates more agile and adaptive cultures, and points a path forward -- all necessary to optimize sales and marketing performance.  Yet, it’s important not to forget that people make all things possible. People are the drivers of information application and change. And sales enablement is important for disruption.  My sales leadership approach is three-fold.  ① I employ customer-centric consultative selling and listen carefully to unearth requirements. Helping customers and companies drive revenue growth is a priority.   ② Next, I build and optimize high-performing sales and marketing programs that tie solutions to services. I analyze which technologies and methods are needed to improve and create effective go-to-market strategies.   ③ Finally, I enable people. I train and mentor to facilitate personal and professional success.  Having spent time in the sales field myself improves my sales leadership. I know first-hand what sales representatives struggle with, and I bridge the gap between sales and marketing and business to create unified success.   With a compelling combination of experience in sales, marketing, & business development, my skills stretch across:  Sales Strategy ● Go-To-Market Strategy ● Analytics ● Enterprise Software Solutions ● Marketing Program Development ● Stakeholder Communications ● Channel Partnerships ● Sales Team Leadership ● Budgeting ● Training ● SaaS ● Data Governance ● Account Management ● Risk Management ● Market Expansion ● Forecasting ● Client Acquisition   Additional value-add:  ✔ Project management expertise; PMP in progress  ✔ IT managed services/telecommunications experience  ✔ Entrepreneurial & corporate experience    LET’S CONNECT!";"Calgary, Alberta, Canada";;"false";"false";"false";"false";"Citrix";;"Sr. Corporate Account Manager, Prairies - West";;"Citrix";"2641";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2641/";"Sr. Corporate Account Manager, Prairies - West";"2022.07";;;"Canada";"https://buff.ly/3EftHYu";"buff.ly";"PredatorGTM";;;"Principal Consultant";"2020.01";"2022.07";"With a reputation for sales and marketing results and a passion for consultative selling, I established this firm to generate meaningful, high-impact go-to-market strategies for clients to accelerate their business growth and profitability.

I’m Alex, VP of Product Development at Adastra Canada. With over 15 years of experience as a business developer, manager, and entrepreneur, I have a proven track record of championing bold and brazen ideas that spark innovation, sustainable growth, and position organizations at the top of their markets.   Over the course of my career, I’ve launched and led companies across multiple industries, including digital marketing, education, and hospitality.  Before joining Adastra, I founded and ran Synapses Marketing. Having built the agency from scratch in 2014, we served clients in North and South America. Prior to Synapses, in 2009, I founded and built the successful Spanish immersion school, Vamos – a 4-time winner of TripAdvisor's Certificate of Excellence. In just 4 months, I was able to turn a profit on the business, and I handed over the reins of management 6 years later, having built one of the most popular language schools in Argentina.  As a hands-on leader, to say I'm passionate about growth and innovation would be an understatement. It’s something I’m obsessed with. I’m always on the hunt to uncover ground-breaking, out-of-the-box ideas that solve issues that seem impossible and will ultimately transform the business.  And I don't give up. Perseverance, and the willingness to stretch far beyond the status quo, are my critical success factors and what I like to instil in my teams.   Strengths include:  ● Leadership ● Strategy  ● Business Development ● Product Development ● Sales ● Branding & Marketing  I’m always keen to connect with colleagues and peers who have audacious goals and are driven to do exceptional things.

Working one-on-one with clients, I’m able to hone in on their needs, which allows me to propose a detailed course of action including everything from graphic design to coding, website development, and architecture to SEO, social media, and content creation.  These days, I manage project teams from around the world to serve clients both local and abroad in industries including finance, education, and hospitality.  This business has rewarded me with a lot of success, but some of my most memorable accomplishments include:  ● Boosting the business of a financial client by 40% in just 12 months through the creation of an online strategy complete with branding, content, and social media plans  ● Developing and driving a holistic marketing strategy, overhauling a website, and building an online presence for an elite athletic country club. This resulted in a boost of 60 new members in only 6 months and 160 after only 1 year.  ● Quadrupling the size of an already successful school over the course of 4 years by developing and executing a comprehensive content plan involving more than 2,000 focused blog posts, and increasing overall site visits and traffic year over year  I’m passionate about seeing businesses grow, whether they are my own or those of a client.

We are looking forward to positioning ourselves as a disruptor in spaces including Artificial Intelligence, Facial Recognition, Emotional Recognition, Blockchain, and Internet of Things to name a few.  My core mandate includes:  ● Leading Adastra through a business-model transformation that will maximize its profitability  ● Championing visionary ideas for futuristic solutions and driving their development from concept to a complete and marketable product  As a serial entrepreneur, I’m excited to infuse the same spirit that made my companies a success, and I’m ready to work incredibly hard—harder than I’ve ever worked before—to elevate the Adastra brand and help the company achieve new heights of success and growth.

The corporate cleaning company started with just 2 clients and 5 part-time staff. By the end of the first year of business, we had expanded to 15 clients and 45 full-time staff.  Tapping into already formed relationships between my business partner and government employees, ERICEP SRL was able to secure opportunities to bid on contracts for the government consisting of 20 governmental buildings, 5 of which were won.  With employees working through massive buildings all across Buenos Aires, we needed to be efficient and to keep costs down. Partnering with a popular mobile phone company in Argentina, I was able to utilize technology available at that time and develop a cell phone tracking system that identified the location of our employees. This initiative helped save our company 20% in labour fees by eliminating the need for an onsite supervisor.

In addition to finding designers and negotiating pricing and inventory, I was also responsible for all legal and accounting needs of the company.

As an Analyst Intern with CMG, I performed analyses that helped clients answer important business questions. This involved extracting and manipulating data from one or more retail databases, determining and executing the appropriate analysis on the data, and succinctly summarizing findings. The analyses were executed in either Excel or R, and often required advanced mathematical or statistical techniques.  I acted as the primary analyst for one client, before moving into an on-site role with a different client. In this on-site capacity, I communicated with, and delivered projects directly to stakeholders in the client's organization.   A major achievement for me at CMG was developing and implementing a mathematical model to predict the probability that an investment (known as slotting) to get a product on shelf at a new retailer would pay off within 52 weeks. The implementation of this model was subsequently delivered to a client of CMG.";"Berkeley, CA";;;"Shoplogix";"61034";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/61034/";"Business Development (Co-op)";"2016.05";"2016.08";"Shoplogix helps discrete manufacturers improve plant culture and communication, by providing production monitoring software that engages employees, helping them gain a thorough, real-time understanding of their performance.

This entailed developing and managing strategic, sales-oriented relationships with key operational stakeholders at discrete manufacturing plants (usually operations and plant managers), and communicating to these stakeholders the benefits of Shoplogix software. As potential customers moved further through the sales process, I also discussed implementation details of the software at these potential customers' plants.  Additionally, in an effort to develop new relationships, I built prospect lists and made 150+ cold calls every week to these prospective customers, setting up a total of 14 presentations with prospective customers in a 16-week time period.  Achievements in this role include: - Developing a professional relationship with one of the top ten automotive parts suppliers via cold calling. This relationship led to the prospective customer installing the Shoplogix system in their plant. - Oversaw the installation of a trial of the Shoplogix system in another large prospective customer's plant, and acted as a primary contact point between Shoplogix and the customer. Based on data collected in this trial of Shoplogix, I developed a business case presentation to demonstrate the ROI that the prospective customer would see were they to purchase Shoplogix.";"Oakville, ON";;;"Self-Employed";;;"Private Math Tutor";"2010";"2016.03";"- Coach struggling students, helping them build proficiency and efficacy in mathematics - Create a positive, collaborative, and fun learning environment - Help students to not just learn facts, but learn effective thought patterns, which will help them successfully solve future mathematical and analytical problems - Justify mathematical theory that is taught to help students develop a deeper understanding of mathematics as a whole - Motivate students, helping them believe in themselves";"Toronto, ON; Waterloo, ON";;;"Kik Interactive, Inc.";"755496";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/755496/";"Release and QA Engineering (Co-op)";"2015.09";"2015.12";"- A member of Kik's visionary team, helping to deliver quality features to Kik's 250 million users worldwide - Designed and executed comprehensive black box test plans for new features being introduced in Kik - Led testing efforts for multiple new features - Analyzed feature specifications to determine testing requirements - Investigated bugs and performed regression testing as necessary - Designed and developed chat-bot experience for internal ""hack"" project";"Waterloo, Ontario";;;"D2L";"19667";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/19667/";"Business Operations Assistant (Co-op)";"2015.01";"2015.04";"- Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 system administration - Customized CRM and automated system processes to improve business efficiency - Analyzed CRM data quality and worked to improve consistency and completeness of data - Built and maintained dashboard reports for sales management - Developed process and best practice documentation - Collaborated with various sales teams to ensure maximum adoption of CRM and other tools - Provided CRM user support as necessary";"Kitchener, Canada Area";;;"Machine Operator";;;"Liturgical Publications of Canada";"2011";"2014";"Part-time work for family business.";"Mississauga, ON";;;"English";"Microsoft Excel : null,R : null,Data Analysis : null,Customer Service : null,Predictive Analytics : null,Leadership : null,Machine Learning : null,Data Science : null,Business Process Improvement : null,Problem Solving : null,Data Management : null,Python : null,C : null,Computer Science : null,Mathematics : null,Collaborative Problem Solving : null,Interpersonal Communication : null,Process Improvement : null,Sales Process : null,Sales Operations : null,Process Automation : null,Tenacious Work Ethic : null,Tutoring : null,Analytical Reasoning : null,Piano Playing : null,Business Operations : null,Community Engagement : null,Meditation : null,Community Development : null,Community Organizing : null,Love Of Learning : null,Ice Hockey : null,Philosophy : null,Enjoy Challenges : null,Product Demonstration : null";;;;;"2";"Ali Sabet";"Brian Vaughan";"Ali Sabet";"Brian Vaughan";;;"669";"DISTANCE_2";"674";"false";"28 October 2022 15:29:55";"1 November 2022 02:11:22";;;;;;;;;;;;;"28665be5b1a7a9bcc2e88e468ebd7695"
